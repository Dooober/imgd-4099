# Assignment 3 - Reaction Diffusion

I implemented Reaction Diffusion with the orientation option. Using the Game of Life example as a starting point, I created a second state array and passed in two buffers to the compute shader. The reaction is oriented by a function that changes the value of the time step depending on the horizontal position of a cell. This creates a cool effect where the reaction will only move to the left after first moving directly vertically. The reaction will travel at different speeds depending on its orientation, moving vertically the fastest, and to the right at a very slow pace. I added controls for each of the constants in the Reaction Diffusion example, including the diffusion rate for both chemicals A and B, the feed rate, and the kill rate. I also added a speed control that changes the base time step.

The feedback was mostly positive with some room for user experience improvemnets. The reaction itself was pleasantly receieved as very asthetically pleasing. The interaction mechanism with Tweakpane could have been improved by changing maximum and minimum values so that users are not able to completely break the reaction on accident. When certain constants are set to low and/or high values, the entire screen will go black and the user will have to reload the page to start the reaction again.
